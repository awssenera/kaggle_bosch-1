# Kaggle Bosch Production Line Performance Competition Model

## Summary
This is an entry for the Kaggle Bosch Production Performance Line competition.
However, it is worth noting, this entry was produced after the competition
closed, so it was not eligible for any awards.  It was initiated for an
opportunity to work with a large data project, warranting a framework like
[Spark](http://spark.apache.org).  Furthermore, it was an opportunity to test 
how [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) performed on Spark on a 
classification problem.

## Technologies Used
